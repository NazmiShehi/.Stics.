# Stics

Stics is a platform for kids that aims at developing their social emotional intelligence through a soft approach to what is basically a life-coahcing experience.
We take traditional one-on-one life-coaching for kids and we bring it in a group format, to make it more playful, engaging, entertaining and richer.
We pair 3-4 english speaking kids from different countries and one professional coach through a videocall (in the premium version) into a "sharing group" where they get into coaching-like activities.
For the free version, coaches and other professionals still develop the activities for the kdis, but they get delivered through a voice-over, with writings and timers appearing on top of the screen to help the kids direct the activity.
